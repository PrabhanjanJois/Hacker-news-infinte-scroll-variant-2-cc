The Hacker News Reader project is using the Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API).
Things I explored and learned by doing this project:

  - Fetching APIs using 'axios'
  - Using Infinite Scroll to limit the calls to the database and provide better UX.
  - Implementing Styled Components
  - Creating Custom Hooks within the React App and more.
  
I built this project with the help of Karl Hadwen (https://youtube.com/c/cognitivesurge)
